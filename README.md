S3 (Simple Stack Script) is a lightweight, stack-based programming language designed for simplicity and power. It combines stack-based execution with variable support, making it an excellent choice for scripting, automation, and embedded systems.

## Important: We are now an officially published Python package!!! 

## üöÄ Features

-   **Stack-Based Execution:** Operates on a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) stack.
-   **Named Variables:** Store and retrieve values easily.
-   **Concise Syntax:** Readable and intuitive for programmers.
-   **Control Flow:** Supports conditionals and loops.
-   **Function Support:** Define and reuse stack-based functions.
-   **Minimal & Fast:** Designed for lightweight execution.
-   **Published Python Package:** You can find our package as [simplestackscript on PyPI.](https://pypi.org/project/simplestackscript/)

## üì• Installation

If you are reading this on PyPI, please use the first installation choice below:

```bash
pip install simplestackscript
```

This is the easiest way to install S3.  pip will automatically download and install the latest version from PyPI.
If you would rather install from source, follow the instructions below:

1.  **Clone the repository with HTTPS:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/CaptioDev/simplestackscript.git
    cd simplestackscript
    ```

2.  **Install the interpreter:**

    ```bash
    pip install .  # Installs the s3 command
    ```

3.  **Run an S3 program:**

    ```bash
    s3 my_program.s3
    ```

> [!NOTE]
> You can also clone the repository using SSH and your GitHub Public Key by replacing the first line with in the first step to: `git clone git@github.com:CaptioDev/simplestackscript.git`

## üìñ Language Reference

S3 uses a stack-based architecture, where most operations manipulate a stack of values.  Instructions are processed sequentially.

### Stack Manipulation

*   **`PUSH <number>`:** Pushes the given `<number>` onto the top of the stack.
*   **`POP`:** Removes the top element from the stack.
*   **`DUP`:** Duplicates the top element of the stack and pushes the copy onto the stack.
*   **`SWAP`:** Swaps the top two elements on the stack.
*   **`OVER`:** Copies the second element from the top of the stack and pushes it onto the top.
*   **`ROT`:** Rotates the top three elements of the stack. The top element becomes the bottom, the second becomes the top, and the third becomes the second.
*   **`DROP`:** Discards (pops) the top element of the stack.
*   **`NIP`:** Removes the second element from the top of the stack.
*   **`TUCK`:** Copies the top element and inserts it *under* the second element.

### Arithmetic Operations

*   **`ADD`:** Pops the top two elements from the stack, adds them, and pushes the result back onto the stack.
*   **`SUB`:** Pops the top two elements (a, b) and pushes `b - a` onto the stack. (Order matters!)
*   **`MUL`:** Pops the top two elements, multiplies them, and pushes the result.
*   **`DIV`:** Pops the top two elements (a, b) and performs integer division `b // a`, pushing the result. (Order matters!)

### Input/Output

*   **`PRINT <string_literal>`:** Prints the given `<string_literal>` to the console.
*   **`READ`:** Reads an integer from the user's input and pushes it onto the stack.
*   **`PRINT.TOP`:** Prints the value at the top of the stack without removing it.

### Control Flow

*   **`JUMP.IF.0 <label>`:** Pops the top element. If it is 0, execution jumps to the line marked by `<label>`. Otherwise, execution continues to the next instruction.
*   **`JUMP.IF.POS <label>`:** Pops the top element. If it is greater than 0, execution jumps to the line marked by `<label>`. Otherwise, execution continues.
*   **`LOOP <line_number>`:** Jumps back to the specified `line_number`. Be careful to avoid infinite loops.

### Program Termination

*   **`HALT`:** Terminates the program execution.

### Labels

*   **`<label>:`:** A label marks a specific location in the program code. It's used as a target for jump instructions. The label itself isn't an opcode; it's a marker.
