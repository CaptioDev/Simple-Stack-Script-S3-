S# (Simple Stack Script) is a lightweight, stack-based programming language designed for simplicity and power. It combines stack-based execution with variable support, making it an excellent choice for scripting, automation, and embedded systems.

## Important: We are now an officially published Python package!!!

> [!CAUTION]
> You are currently on the experimental branch of S#. We are currently testing new syntax for the language and you might come accross various issues and bugs. We recommend you switch to the main branch, or for bleeding updates, check for any feature/* brances!

## üöÄ Features

-   **Stack-Based Execution:** Operates on a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) stack.
-   **Named Variables:** Store and retrieve values easily.
-   **Concise Syntax:** Readable and intuitive for programmers.
-   **Control Flow:** Supports conditionals and loops.
-   **Function Support:** Define and reuse stack-based functions.
-   **Minimal & Fast:** Designed for lightweight execution.
-   **Published Python Package:** You can find our package as [simplestackscript on PyPI.](https://pypi.org/project/simplestackscript/)
-   **Enhanced Error Handling:** Improved validation and debugging messages.
-   **New Opcodes:** `WAIT` for delay execution and enhanced loop support.

## üì• Installation

If you are reading this on PyPI, please use the first installation choice below:

```bash
pip install simplestackscript
```

This is the easiest way to install S#.  pip will automatically download and install the latest version from PyPI.
If you would rather install from source, follow the instructions below:

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/CaptioDev/simplestackscript.git
    cd simplestackscript
    ```

2.  **Install the interpreter:**

    ```bash
    pip install .  # Installs the s3 command
    ```

3.  **Run an S3 program:**

    ```bash
    s3 my_program.s3
    ```

> [!NOTE]
> You can also clone the repository using SSH and your GitHub Public Key by replacing the first line within the first step to: `git clone git@github.com:CaptioDev/simplestackscript.git`

## üìñ Language Reference

S# uses a stack-based architecture, where most operations manipulate a stack of values.  Instructions are processed sequentially.

### Stack Manipulation

*   **`PUSH <number>`:** Pushes the given `<number>` onto the top of the stack.
*   **`POP`:** Removes the top element from the stack.
*   **`DUP`:** Duplicates the top element of the stack and pushes the copy onto the stack.
*   **`SWAP`:** Swaps the top two elements on the stack.
*   **`OVER`:** Copies the second element from the top of the stack and pushes it onto the top.
*   **`ROT`:** Rotates the top three elements of the stack.
*   **`DROP`:** Discards (pops) the top element of the stack.
*   **`NIP`:** Removes the second element from the top of the stack.
*   **`TUCK`:** Copies the top element and inserts it *under* the second element.

### Arithmetic Operations

*   **`ADD`:** Pops the top two elements from the stack, adds them, and pushes the result back onto the stack.
*   **`SUB`:** Pops the top two elements (a, b) and pushes `b - a` onto the stack.
*   **`MUL`:** Pops the top two elements, multiplies them, and pushes the result.
*   **`DIV`:** Pops the top two elements (a, b) and performs integer division `b // a`, pushing the result.

### Input/Output

*   **`PRINT <string_literal>`:** Prints the given `<string_literal>` to the console.
*   **`READ`:** Reads an integer from the user's input and pushes it onto the stack.
*   **`PRINT.TOP`:** Prints the value at the top of the stack without removing it.

### Control Flow

*   **`JUMP <label>`:** Jumps to the specified `<label>`.
*   **`JUMP.IF.0 <label>`:** Pops the top element. If it is 0, execution jumps to `<label>`.
*   **`JUMP.IF.POS <label>`:** Pops the top element. If it is greater than 0, execution jumps to `<label>`.
*   **`LOOP <line_number> <repeat_count>`:** Loops execution from `line_number` for `repeat_count` times.

### Program Termination

*   **`HALT`:** Terminates the program execution.

### Labels

*   **`<label>:`:** A label marks a specific location in the program code. Used as a target for jump instructions.

### New Instructions

*   **`WAIT <milliseconds>`:** Pauses execution for the specified number of milliseconds before proceeding.

## üìù Examples

```ssharp
# Example: Adding two numbers
PUSH 5
PUSH 10
ADD
PRINT.TOP  # Output: 15
HALT

# Example: Input and output
PRINT "Enter a number:"
READ
PRINT "You entered:"
PRINT.TOP
HALT

# Example: Looping
PUSH 5
LOOP 0 3  # Loop 3 times, jumping to line 0
HALT

# Example: Using WAIT
PRINT "Waiting for 3 seconds..."
WAIT 3000
PRINT "Done!"
HALT
```
